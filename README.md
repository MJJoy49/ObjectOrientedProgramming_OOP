# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

**_The basic OOP concept has 3 type_**

- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism


### **Encapsulation**

Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up data and information under a single unit to manipulate them

In this example, the age attribute is private, and we manipulate it using the public property Age, ensuring that only valid values can be assigned to age.



### **Abstraction**

Data Abstraction refers to providing only essential information to the outside world and hiding the background details, i.e., representing the needed information in the program without presenting the details.
#### Example: *public*, *private*, *protected*
